# Jetpack Compose Submission Project
This my first Jetpack Compose project I made for my assignment. The name of the application is MyAnimeList. Just like the name, the application can show list of all animes and each of it's detail (synopsis, genre, rating). I also implemented API provided by [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net/) to get all the data of existing anime.
